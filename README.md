How to open the app: 

After cloning the files to a Macbook with Xcode running on it, open the folders and open the .xcodeproj files with Xcode

Turn the debugger on for both files to see the information getting stored in the database (version 1.1)
and for appending the lists (version 1.0)

Run the program on iPhone 6s simulator available near the top left corner of Xcode and you are good to go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once in the app through simulator:

click a button, or type something and keep looking at the debugger to notice what your actions do.
